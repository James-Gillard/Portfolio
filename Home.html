                    <h4>How i found my calling!</h4>
                    <p>I am an ex casino manager now looking for my newest challenge.
                        As if by chance i overheard some people discussing being 
                        software developers and spent a 45 minute walk listening in on
                        what it is they do. Once i got home i set about looking into
                        anything and everything i could find. I was extremely intrigued
                        to say the least and my software developing journey began.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What next!</h4>
                    <p>I have enjoyed every second of my journey so far and can't wait to
                        start working and am very excited to take my first steps into the 
                        life of a working software developer.

                        <p>This is my favourite project i have worked on, My family have started a golf society where 10 of us play
                            2/3 times a year. At the end of each day one person spent hours sorting everyones scores and handicaps. 
                            This is what motivated me to build this app, it started off as a way for everyone to import each round onto
                            the app and for everything to be calculated automatically but has now turned into a full society webpage.
